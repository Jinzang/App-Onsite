App::Onsite version 0.001
=========================

App::Onsite is a CGI script which allows you to edit your web pages on your
web site, add new pages, and delete existing pages. There is no backing
database. All the information about what to edit is contained in comments
in the web page, which delimit the sections of the page that can be edited.

This software is still alpha. It needs more documentation (obviously) and
several modules need to be written to complete the functionality.

INSTALLATION
============

Unpack these files on your computer and edit the files

  site/index.html
  site/Style.css

to give the site the look you want. Be careful to not modify the html comments
surrounding the editable text.

Ftp these files to your webserver, login to the webserver and cd to the top level
directory the files are installed in. Type the command

  perl scripts/install.pl .
